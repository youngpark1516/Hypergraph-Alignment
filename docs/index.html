    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Accurate 3D point cloud alignment is used for shape correspondence, reconstruction,
        and tracking. In practice, alignment is challenging due to non-rigid deformation,
        partial observations, and noise.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project studies one key design choice in hypergraph alignment pipelines:
        how to aggregate neighborhood (hyperedge) information. Instead of mean pooling,
        we use a Wasserstein-based aggregation that is more sensitive to the distribution
        of features within a neighborhood.
      </p>

      <ul class="takeaways">
        <li>
          <strong>Wasserstein aggregation in hypergraph layers:</strong>
          Replace mean pooling with optimal-transport-inspired aggregation to better preserve
          multi-modal neighborhood structure.

    <!-- PROBLEM SETUP -->
    <section id="problem" class="section">
      <h2>Problem setup</h2>
      <p>
        Given a source point cloud and a target point cloud, our goal is to predict
        correct point-to-point correspondences between the two shapes (dense or semi-dense),
        even when the data includes non-rigid deformation, partial overlap, and noise.
      </p>
      <p>
        We frame this as a classification problem over candidate source–target pairs:
        each candidate pair is predicted as an inlier (true correspondence) or outlier.
        During evaluation, candidates are generated using k-nearest neighbors in feature space.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- WHY THIS MATTERS -->
    <section id="motivation" class="section">
      <h2>Why this matters</h2>

      <p>
        Many alignment pipelines rely on local neighborhoods to decide whether a candidate
        correspondence is geometrically consistent. If neighborhood features are summarized poorly,
        the model can confuse true matches with outliers, especially under deformation, partial overlap,
        and noise.
      </p>

      <p>
        A common choice in learning-based hypergraph alignment (including standard HyperGCT) is to use
        mean pooling to summarize hyperedge information. Mean pooling is simple and efficient, but it can
        blur multi-modal neighborhoods and wash out small but important structures. This motivates using a
        distribution-aware aggregation that better preserves how features are spread within a neighborhood.
      </p>

      <details class="details">
        <summary>Technical note</summary>
        <div class="details-body">
          <p>
            Let a hyperedge (neighborhood) contain feature vectors
            <code>{h1, h2, ..., hk}</code> with <code>hi ∈ R^d</code>.
            Standard HyperGCT-style aggregation uses mean pooling:
          </p>

          <pre><code>m_mean = (1/k) * Σ_i hi</code></pre>

          <p>
            Mean pooling compresses the entire set into one vector, but different neighborhoods
            can share the same mean even if their feature distributions are very different.
            To keep distributional information, we treat the neighborhood as an empirical measure:
          </p>

          <pre><code>μ = (1/k) * Σ_i δ(hi)</code></pre>

          <p>
            Our idea is to aggregate by comparing this distribution to a learned reference
            distribution <code>ν</code> using an optimal transport (Wasserstein) distance.
            A common practical approximation is the sliced Wasserstein distance, which projects
            features onto 1D directions <code>θ</code> and averages 1D Wasserstein distances:
          </p>

          <pre><code>SW(μ, ν) = (1/L) * Σ_{ℓ=1..L}  W1( P_{θℓ}# μ , P_{θℓ}# ν )</code></pre>

          <p>
            where <code>P_{θ}#</code> denotes the pushforward distribution after projection onto
            direction <code>θ</code>, and <code>W1</code> is the 1D Wasserstein-1 distance computed
            from sorted projected samples. Intuitively, mean pooling keeps only the first moment,
            while Wasserstein-style aggregation is sensitive to how mass is arranged, helping
            preserve multi-modal neighborhood structure.

          <h3>ICP (Iterative Closest Point)</h3>
          <p>
            ICP is a classical alignment method that alternates between assigning closest-point
            correspondences and updating the transformation. It works well for rigid or near-rigid
            cases but can be sensitive to initialization and can struggle under partial overlap,
            noise, and non-rigid deformation.

          <h3>HyperGCT (dynamic hypergraph alignment baseline)</h3>
          <p>
            HyperGCT builds a dynamic hypergraph over candidate correspondences and uses hypergraph
            message passing to classify inliers vs. outliers. In the standard HyperGCT pipeline,
            neighborhood (hyperedge) information is summarized using mean pooling. Our method keeps
            the same overall structure and replaces this mean pooling step with Wasserstein-based
            aggregation.

            Precision = TP / (TP + FP), Recall = TP / (TP + FN),

          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Aggregatedness:</strong>
            measures how concentrated predicted inlier mass is within hyperedges.
            Let <code>s_v</code> be the predicted inlier score for node (candidate pair) <code>v</code>.
            For each hyperedge <code>e</code> with nodes <code>V(e)</code>, define the normalized mass
            <code>p_v = s_v / (Σ_{u∈V(e)} s_u + ε)</code>.
            Aggregatedness is the average concentration over hyperedges:
          </p>
          <pre><code>A = (1/|E|) * Σ_{e∈E} Σ_{v∈V(e)} p_v^2</code></pre>
          <p>
            Higher <code>A</code> means scores collapse onto a few nodes per hyperedge (more “peaky”);
            lower <code>A</code> means scores are spread out.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Disjointness:</strong>
            measures how much hyperedges overlap in membership. For hyperedges <code>e</code> and <code>f</code>,
            define overlap via Jaccard similarity <code>J(e,f) = |V(e)∩V(f)| / |V(e)∪V(f)|</code>.
            Disjointness is one minus average overlap over sampled/neighboring hyperedge pairs:
          </p>
          <pre><code>D = 1 - (1/|P|) * Σ_{(e,f)∈P} J(e,f)</code></pre>
          <p>
            Higher <code>D</code> means hyperedges share fewer nodes (cleaner separation).
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>In-edge distance consistency:</strong>
            measures geometric consistency within each hyperedge. Each node <code>v=(i,j)</code>
            corresponds to a source point <code>p_i</code> and target point <code>q_j</code>.
            For a hyperedge <code>e</code>, compute pairwise source distances
            <code>d_src(v,u)=||p_i - p_{i'}||</code> and target distances
            <code>d_tgt(v,u)=||q_j - q_{j'}||</code> for nodes <code>v=(i,j)</code>, <code>u=(i',j')</code>.
            The consistency error per pair is <code>Δ(v,u) = |d_src(v,u) - d_tgt(v,u)|</code>.
            We report variance within each hyperedge, averaged across hyperedges:
          </p>
          <pre><code>C = (1/|E|) * Σ_{e∈E} Var_{v,u∈V(e), v≠u} [ Δ(v,u) ]</code></pre>
          <p>
            Lower <code>C</code> means a hyperedge’s correspondences agree more strongly on geometry.
