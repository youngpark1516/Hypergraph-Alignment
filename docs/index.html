    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Accurate 3D point cloud alignment is used for shape correspondence, reconstruction,
        and tracking. In practice, alignment is challenging due to non-rigid deformation,
        partial observations, and noise.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project studies one key design choice in hypergraph alignment pipelines:
        how to aggregate neighborhood (hyperedge) information. Instead of mean pooling,
        we use a Wasserstein-based aggregation that is more sensitive to the distribution
        of features within a neighborhood.
      </p>

      <h3 class="subhead">What we contribute</h3>
      <ul class="takeaways">
        <li>
          <strong>Wasserstein aggregation in hypergraph layers:</strong>
          Replace mean pooling with optimal-transport-inspired aggregation to better preserve
          multi-modal neighborhood structure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Placement study:</strong>
          Compare where this aggregation is most effective (early vs. late vs. multiple layers).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Alternative hypothesis generation:</strong>
          Implement a matching-based hypothesis generation step as an alternative to ICP for
          piecewise-rigid alignment settings.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <!-- PROBLEM SETUP -->
    <section id="problem" class="section">
      <h2>Problem setup</h2>
      <p>
        Given a source point cloud and a target point cloud, our goal is to predict
        correct point-to-point correspondences between the two shapes (dense or semi-dense),
        even when the data includes non-rigid deformation, partial overlap, and noise.
      </p>
      <p>
        We frame this as a classification problem over candidate source–target pairs:
        each candidate pair is predicted as an inlier (true correspondence) or outlier.
        During evaluation, candidates are generated using k-nearest neighbors in feature space.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- MOTIVATION -->
    <section id="motivation" class="section">
      <h2>Why this matters</h2>
      <p>
        Many alignment systems depend on local neighborhoods being represented well enough to
        disambiguate correspondences. When neighborhoods are multi-modal or sampling density
        changes, simple averaging can blur important structure and reduce robustness.
      </p>

      <details class="details">
        <summary>Optional: one-paragraph technical context</summary>
        <div class="details-body">
          <p>
            Hypergraph models represent higher-order relationships (groups of points), which can
            better capture local geometric consistency than pairwise edges alone. The choice of
            aggregation inside these hypergraph layers can influence both accuracy and robustness.

        <div class="card">
          <h3>ICP (Iterative Closest Point)</h3>
          <p>
            ICP is a classical alignment method that alternates between assigning closest-point
            correspondences and updating the transformation. It is a strong starting point for
            rigid or near-rigid registration, but can be sensitive to initialization and can
            struggle under partial overlap, noise, and non-rigid deformation.

        <div class="card">
          <h3>HyperGCT (dynamic hypergraph alignment baseline)</h3>
          <p>
            HyperGCT represents candidate correspondences as nodes in a dynamic hypergraph and
            uses hypergraph message passing to classify inliers vs. outliers. Our project keeps
            this overall structure and changes a key internal component: how neighborhood
            (hyperedge) features are aggregated.

    <!-- PIPELINE -->

      <h2>Pipeline (high-level)</h2>

      <p>
        Our system follows the overall structure of a dynamic hypergraph alignment baseline (HyperGCT):
        we build a hypergraph over candidate correspondences and refine them through hypergraph message passing.
        Our main change is replacing mean pooling inside hypergraph layers with Wasserstein-based aggregation.
      </p>

      <ol class="pipeline">
        <li>
          <strong>Generate candidate correspondences:</strong>
          form source–target pairs (train: labeled positives/negatives; eval: kNN candidates).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Build a dynamic hypergraph:</strong>
          treat each candidate pair as a node and group nodes into hyperedges based on geometric consistency.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hypergraph message passing:</strong>
          update node features and predict an inlier confidence score per candidate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wasserstein aggregation (our focus):</strong>
          replace mean pooling with a distribution-aware aggregation in selected layers
          (we compare different insertion points).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hypothesis generation:</strong>
          use predicted inliers to produce an alignment hypothesis (matching-based alternative to ICP).

      <p>
        We evaluate on standard 3D datasets under multiple perturbation settings. We report
        correspondence quality using standard classification metrics, and we also use structural
        diagnostics to understand hypergraph quality and robustness behavior.

    <!-- RESULTS -->

      <h2>Results & takeaways</h2>
      <p>
        Overall, our results indicate that Wasserstein-based aggregation can improve performance
        over mean pooling and can change robustness behavior across perturbation regimes.
      </p>

      <ul class="takeaways">
        <li><strong>Takeaway 1:</strong> Distribution-aware aggregation can preserve local structure that averaging loses.</li>
        <li><strong>Takeaway 2:</strong> Where you insert Wasserstein aggregation (early vs. late) can matter.</li>
        <li><strong>Takeaway 3:</strong> Robustness behavior can shift across perturbation settings.</li>
