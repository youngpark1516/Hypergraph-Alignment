    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Accurate 3D point cloud alignment is used for shape correspondence, reconstruction,
        and tracking. In practice, alignment is hard because of non-rigid deformation, partial
        observations, and noise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our project focuses on a specific part of hypergraph learning pipelines: how we
        summarize neighborhood (hyperedge) information. Instead of averaging (mean pooling),
        we use a distribution-aware aggregation based on optimal transport ideas.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- MOTIVATION -->
    <section id="motivation" class="section">
      <h2>Why this matters</h2>
      <p>
        Many alignment systems depend on local neighborhoods being represented well enough to
        disambiguate correspondences. When neighborhoods are multi-modal or sampling density
        changes, simple averaging can blur important structure and reduce robustness.
      </p>

        <summary>Optional: one-paragraph technical context</summary>
        <div class="details-body">
          <p>
            Hypergraph models represent higher-order relationships (groups of points), which can
            better capture local geometric consistency than pairwise edges alone. The choice of
            aggregation inside these hypergraph layers can influence both accuracy and robustness.

    <!-- APPROACH -->
    <section id="approach" class="section">
      <h2>Approach (high-level)</h2>

      <div class="bullets">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Start from a hypergraph alignment baseline</h3>
          <p>
            We build on a dynamic hypergraph pipeline for point cloud alignment that groups
            candidate correspondences into hyperedges and refines them through message passing.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Replace mean pooling with Wasserstein aggregation</h3>
          <p>
            Instead of summarizing a neighborhood by a single average vector, we treat the set of
            neighborhood features as a distribution and aggregate in a way that is sensitive to
            how that “mass” is arranged in feature space.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Provide a matching-based hypothesis generation step</h3>
          <p>
            We also implement a matching-based hypothesis generation procedure as an alternative
            to Iterative Closest Point (ICP) for piecewise-rigid settings.

    <!-- EVALUATION -->
    <section id="evaluation" class="section">
      <h2>Evaluation (high-level)</h2>
      <p>
        We evaluate on standard 3D datasets under multiple perturbation settings. We report
        correspondence quality using standard classification metrics, and we also use structural
        diagnostics to understand hypergraph quality and robustness behavior.

    <!-- RESULTS -->
    <section id="results" class="section">
      <h2>Results & takeaways</h2>
      <p>
        Overall, our results indicate that Wasserstein-based aggregation can improve performance
        over mean pooling and can change robustness behavior across perturbation regimes.
      </p>

      <ul class="takeaways">
        <li><strong>Takeaway 1:</strong> Distribution-aware aggregation can preserve local structure that averaging loses.</li>
        <li><strong>Takeaway 2:</strong> Where you insert Wasserstein aggregation (early vs. late) can matter.</li>
        <li><strong>Takeaway 3:</strong> Robustness behavior can shift across perturbation settings.</li>
      </ul>
